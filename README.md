# Plex Requests - Meteor Style!

This is an early **ALPHA** release of the next version of Plex Requests! Please be aware that things will break, that I am 100% certain of.

**WARNING**
Under no circumstances should you update your existing install with this one. Create a separate folder, and install a fresh copy. The Settings side of things have been completed re-worked and I'm brainstorming ways to best moves your settings over when you upgrade. In addition more data is stored for requests (and some formats changed) and this hasn't been tested yet in an upgrade process.

Again--DO NOT UPGRADE--create a new installation to test and play around with.

**Things That Work**

  - Searching for Movies / TV Shows
  - Requesting Movies
  - Requests Page
  - Settings Page (available at `/about`)
  - CouchPotato/SickRage/Sonarr should all Work

**Things That DO NOT Work**

  - Requesting TV Shows
  - Alerts via either service
  - Tests for CouchPotato/SickRage/Sonarr/Pushover/Pushbullet
  - Upgrading from previous installations

Please report any and all issues as you come across them. I'm actively working on this branch so check back often for new updates.
