#Plex Requests - Meteor Style!

![plexrequestshomepage](Screenshot.png)
This is Plex Requests but written with Meteor! It doesn't do everything the Django version does (it doesn't tie into Couch Potato yet) but I'm hoping to bring them up to feature parity. While it's missing some things it also adds some! Primarily, it allows you to view requested movies and does a check against these movies when trying to add new ones.

For more details regarding Plex Requests view the original Django repo [here](https://github.com/lokenx/plexrequests) and a demo of this version is hosted on Meteor at [http://plexrequests.meteor.com](http://plexrequests.meteor.com).
