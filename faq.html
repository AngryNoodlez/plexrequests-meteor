        <p class="intro">Answers to some frequently asked questions that will hopefully help you get Plex Requests up and running smoothly!</p>
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <br>

        <h4 id="whats-this-new-account-business">What’s this new account business?</h4>
        <p>After some thought, and with the help of <a href="https://github.com/Jeradin">@jeradin</a>, users now require authentication to make requests. They just need their username so no passwords are required for ease of entry. A local token is also saved for future visits. Administrators can see who has submitted each requests, while users are not shown this information.</p>
        <br>

        <h4 id="can-i-turn-authentication-off">Do I have to use authentication?</h4>
        <p>No, authentication is now off by default. Users are still asked to enter their Plex.tv username but it does not check them against your friends or managed users, merely shows you who is requesting content.</p>
        <br>

        <h4>Is there a way to approve requests?</h4>
        <p>Yes! By default requests do not require approval. This setting can be turned on in admin page. Any requests require your approval, which can be done from the requests page.</p>
        <br>

        <h4 id="how-often-are-movies-removed-from-the-requested-list">How often are movies and TV series removed from the requested list?</h4>
        <p>Requests aren't removed anymore. You have sort and filtering options, and an infinitely scrolling list of requests.</p>
        <br>

        <h4 id="why-cant-i-find-the-movie-i-want-the-search-results-suck">Why can’t I find the movie I want? The search results suck!</h4>
        <p>We have recently switched to using <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank">TheMovieDB</a> API for our search results. It has great support for both Movies and TV series, and handles foreign language titles great as well. If you've any issues with the search results please let me know!</p>
        <br>

        <h4 id="can-i-run-this-on-my-synologyqnaprasberry-pi">Can I run this on my Synology/QNAP/Rasberry Pi?</h4>
        <p>Your deployment options are limited to platforms that <a href="https://www.meteor.com">Meteor</a> supports, so the short answer is no. However, if you’re so inclined, and your platform supports <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, you should be able to get it running using the <a href="https://github.com/onmodulus/demeteorizer">demeteorizer</a>.</p>
